# ShopLite Store

![Deploy](https://github.com/Salama-Malek/shoplite-store/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)

Live demo: https://salama-malek.github.io/shoplite-store/

A fast, dark-themed React storefront demo for browsing, filtering, and buying a curated product catalog.

## Overview

ShopLite Store is a single-page e-commerce front end built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It showcases a product catalog with search, category filtering, sorting, pagination, a wishlist, a shopping cart with tax/total calculation, and a mock checkout flow, all persisted to `localStorage` so the cart and preferences survive a page reload.

## Features

- Product catalog with client-side search, category filtering, and sorting (price/name, ascending/descending)
- Infinite-scroll style pagination ("load more") via a reusable `usePagination` hook
- Product detail modal with a "recently viewed" rail
- Wishlist page with persisted favorites, synced through `localStorage`
- Shopping cart drawer with quantity controls, subtotal/tax/total calculation, and a mock checkout confirmation
- Toast notifications for cart actions
- Responsive mobile filter/sort modal (built on Headless UI) separate from the desktop filter bar
- Keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+K) to focus the search bar
- Scroll-aware header and a "back to top" button
- Skeleton loading states and Framer Motion animations throughout
- Dark theme by default via Tailwind's class-based dark mode

## Tech stack

- Tailwind CSS (with a custom color/animation theme)
